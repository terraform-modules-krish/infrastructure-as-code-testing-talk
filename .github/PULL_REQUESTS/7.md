# Fixing the parsing url error

**jonathancarvalheiro** commented *Mar 30, 2021*

When I run this test I got this error:
retry.go:84: HTTP GET to URL "https://dummy.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/live" returned an error: parse "\"https://dummy.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/live\"": first path segment in URL cannot contain colon. Sleeping for 3s and will try again.

The proposed change fixes this.

Ah, that's due to a backwards incompatible change to `terraform output` that landed in Terraform 0.14. The proper fix is to update to a newer version of Terratest!
