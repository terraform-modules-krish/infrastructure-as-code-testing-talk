# Added AWS CDK app

**bwhaley** commented *Dec 1, 2019*

This adds a CDK Typescript app to demonstrate tests using the CDK. I'm using this app along with some of the the existing modules/examples in this repo for my talk at re:Invent. Care to include it here?

Thanks for the review! I've made the suggested changes in the most recent commit. Will keep this open in case I make further changes in the next day or two.
